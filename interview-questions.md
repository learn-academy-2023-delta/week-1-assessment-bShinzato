# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a verison control that exists on local PCs. The difference between git and github is that Github is located in the cloud or online while git stays on your local PC. 

Researched answer: Git was invented in 2005 and by Linus Torvalds. Also, it is an acronym for Global Information Tracker. In addition it is a free, open-sourced version control system widely used in the programming world. It manages all source code history. Each developer must have Git installed on his or her local device before collaberating with others. Github differniates from git by serving as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository. It is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. In addition, it helps developers share repositories for collaberation.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Booleans are great for comparisons and will return a true or false value. The operators that will return a boolean value are: equality operators, relational operators, and logical operators.

Researched answer: Within the operators that will return a Boolean value can be broken down into more concise wording. Firstly, Equality Operators has two different types: loose equality operator and strict equality operator. The loose equality operator will convert the two items to the same data type before making a comparison. In contrast, the strict equality operator requires the two items being compared be the same data type. Second, relational operators consist of mathematical relationship signs to compare values. The relationship signs consist of: > greater than, < less than, >= greater than or equal to, and <= less than or equal to. Lastly Logical Operators consist of: and, or, and not. The logical and is denoted by && and states that both sides of the equation must be true to return the Boolean value true. Next, the logical or is denoted by || and states that only one side of the equation must be true. Lastly, the logical not is denoted by a banger operator as an !, it sets the logical opposite.

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The array's index correlates with the array's element starting at 0. Each element within the array is its value.

Researched answer: An array's index gives a particular location in the array for every element. In contrast, an array's value is the content of each element listed in the array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: The similiarites of arrays and strings is that an array can have elements of strings, both include zero indexing, and both can include built-in methods. In contrast, you can invoke the string variable name, while when invoking an array, it will need parenthesis after the array variable name. Also, an array has multiple data within it, while the string only can store one data type. 

Researched answer: Arrays and strings are the similar by having a fix sized, can be stored similar to an array, and briefly the string is an array but only for characters. They are both different by: An array can store a collection set of elements that are the same data type, while a string is a set of characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In pair programming both parties should be open minded to each others input. Do not discourage each others inputs and encourage curiosity for ideas. Always be willingly to try new ideas from either party. The roles of pair programming are a Driver and Navigator. The driver types the code while the navigator focuses on the goal of what is being programmed. Also, overlooks ideas and helps the driver by telling him or her what to type or to fix.

Researched answer: For pair programming have two sets of eyes would make it easier to catch mistakes, both have different knowledge and strengths which can lead to a better situation, both hold each other accountable for temptation of taking shortcuts, and verbal communication can help both parties understanding of prgramming. In addition, the roles of a driver is the individual with his or her hands on the keyboard. He or she is responsible for inputting the infromation while following the directions of the navigator. The navigator observes the code for errors, listens to verbal output from the driver, suggests advice, and thinks of the bigger picture of the code. Both should switch roles 10-25 mins.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-Order functions takes a function as an argument and designed to function on arrays. The argument will have parameters. So the Higher-Order Functions will turn a function into an argument within an conditional or an arrow function but will invoke the varaiable that it is attached to for the new output. 

2. Jest: Jest is used for testing snippets of code called dependencies. It will point at where the code failed and tell you a reference error according to the test. It can also run multiple expect statements. Jest is a framework to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

3. Objects: Objects are static information to be called upon. Static information is usually information that is not changed after being inputted. Examples are: Name, DOB, etc. These are called key:value pairs. 

4. Method: Methods correlate with Objects. When an object has a function to call return static information, it is called a method. 

5. Classes: Classes are the blueprint of objects. Also, it contains data and behavior. Classes are reusuable and each object created from the class is Independent from one another. In addition, classes can store any type of data. Uses: constructor, this, and new - to access information within a class. Classes correlate to Objects and Methods.
